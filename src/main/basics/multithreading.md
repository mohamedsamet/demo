## Definition
Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

threads use a shared memory area. They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process

Threads are independent. If there occurs exception in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads. It uses a shared memory area.
